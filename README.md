# Customer Service AI Agent

A simple yet powerful **AI Customer Service Agent** that can:
- Answer customer questions  
- Recommend available services  
- Enroll users when eligible  
- Handle multiple users concurrently  
- Remember past conversations  

> 🚀 This project demonstrates how to build a production-style AI assistant with **RAG, LangGraph orchestration, and a full-stack setup**.  

---

## 🔎 How It Works

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** → powered by [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index)  
  - Service catalogs, descriptions, and pricing are indexed  
  - Context stored in **ChromaDB**  

- **Orchestration** → [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) + [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)  
  - Multi-step reasoning and workflow handling  

- **Backend** → Flask REST API  
- **Frontend** → [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) web interface
